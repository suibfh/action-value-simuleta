# Stage 6: Effect Logic Integration

This stage will implement actual simulation logic for:
- Applying agility buffs / slows with % modification
- Adding or subtracting flat action values at the correct timing
- Respecting turn-based duration of effects
- Re-running the simulation with effects applied

Ready to proceed with code integration.
